# Simon-Game

The Simon game is an electronic game of short-term memory skill. It was invented by Ralph H. Baer and Howard J. Morrison, and it requires the player to repeat a series of tones and lights. The game becomes progressively more complex as the player succeeds, and it is over when the user fails or the time limit runs out. The game has been popularized in various forms, including a handheld electronic version for kids ages 8 and up. Additionally, there are online versions available for play. The game is known for its ability to challenge memory and is suitable for individuals or groups[4].
